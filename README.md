# CreatePerfectRecipe
- Our CS 478 Team Project consists of gathering/formatting data and running several machine learning algortihms on data from recipe sites.
## Objective
- Train machine learning algorithms to rate recipes based on:
  - Ingredients
  - Time
  - Nutritional Value
  - Etc
## Phases
1. We use the Chrome Extension WebScraper to get the raw data from recipe sites such as AllRecipes. 
2. We will then run some algorithms on the data to format it into a common format that can be run through a machine learning algorithm.
3. Finally we will train several machine learning algorithms (from tensorflow) on the data.
4. We will compile the results and present them to the class.
