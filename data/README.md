# Data Folder
## Purpose
- The data folder contains and organizes all data associated with the project
## Subfolders
- raw is the folder where all of the raw data we get from scraping goes (all .csv and .json)
- db and log are folders that exist locally on the computer with the database, but are absent in cloned repositories, thus why they are in the .gitignore
